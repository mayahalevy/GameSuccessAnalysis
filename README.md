# Game Success Analysis

Analyzing user and expert reviews, genres, platforms, and historical data on game sales that are available from open sources. I will identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. I will be forecasting 2017 sales based on data from 2016.

###Conclusions:

○ Data collection should check updating 'tbd' values in user_score.

○ Most of the games were released between 5 to 15 years ago.

○ Successfull platforms tend to reach thier overall peak sales after approximatley 4 years, if the platform hasn't reached high enough sales after this period it will die off. The lifetime of a successfull platform is between approximatley 10 years. 
Successfull platforms tend to have games with high total sales.

○ Scores of critics have a medium low influence on sales, while user score dosent have an influence except for in Japan where user score has a small influence. In general games that have high total sales have a high critic score. Except for in Japan user score is not an indicator of game success.  
Critic score has a medium high corralation with user score, users tend to agree with critics but not all the time.

○ In North America, Europe, and other regions genres with high sales are physical, imersive ,and dynamic. The genres with low sales are monotonous, and require thinking and skills that take time to develope. In Japan high selling games tend to be very immersive and self expressive.

○ There is a diffrence in popularity of platforms between Japan and the rest of the regions, while Europe amd Other have similar platform popularity and North America is also similar but has a diffrent number one.

○ Ratings of games in the diffrent regions is an extension of the diffrences of genres popularity.

○ Average game user rating dosen't seem to be effected by the platform type, but it seems to be effected by genre.
